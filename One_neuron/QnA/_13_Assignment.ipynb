    "#### 1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "Excel is used to displays the data in horizontal and vertical rows. The data are usually stored in the cells. We have an option of formulas in Excel that can be used for data and its place of storage. You can even add any charts, graphics, etc. to make it more presentable.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV refers to Comma-Separated Values. It holds plain text as a series of values (cells) separated by commas (, ) in a series of lines (rows). CSV file can actually open in a text editor and read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus,\n",
    "In Excel, spreadsheets can have values of data types other than strings; cells can have different fonts, sizes, or color settings; cells can have varying widths and heights; adjacent cells can be merged; and you can embed images and charts.While Excel (XLS and XLSX) file formats are better for storing more complex data, CSV files are supported by nearly all data upload interfaces"
