    "#### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "A lambda expression is an expression which evaluates to a function object, while a def statement has no value, and creates a function object and binds it to a name."

    "**Ans:** \n",
    "Lambda functions are used when you need a function for a short period of time. This is commonly used when you want to pass a function as an argument to higher-order functions, that is, functions that take other functions as their arguments"

    "#### 3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "- map() : Map operation takes a mapping function and a vector of data as arguments and returns a new vector, The returned value from map() (map object) then can be passed to functions like list() (to create a list), set() (to create a set) and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- filter() :The filter function operates on a list and returns a subset of that list after applying the filtering rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- reduce() :The reduce function will transform a given list into a single value by applying a given function continuously to all the elements. It basically keeps operating on pairs of elements until there are no more elements left.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to map(), filter() takes a function object and an iterable and creates a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* reduce() works differently than map() and filter(). It does not return a new list based on the function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value."

    "#### 4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "Function annotations, both for parameters and return values, are completely optional. Function annotations are nothing more than a way of associating arbitrary Python expressions with various parts of a function at compile-time. By itself, Python does not attach any particular meaning or significance to annotations."

    "#### 5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "**Ans:** A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The process may repeat several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration."
