  <h2><li> What is Machine Learning </li></h2>
 Arthur Samuel coined the term Machine Learning in 1959. He defined it as “Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence
(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn
and improve from experience without being explicitly
programmed"
  Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and it allows machines to learn from their experiences without any coding.

  <ol>
      <li> Supervised Learning </li>
      <ul><li>Supervised Learning is the one, where you can consider the learning is guided by a teacher.</li>
          <li>In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the               input and the output.</li>
          <li>Supervised learning problems are further categorized into Regression and Classification problems.</li></ul>
     <li> Unsupervised Learning </li>
      <ul> <li>This approach is the one where the output is unknown, and we have only the input variable at hand. The algorithm learns by itself and discovers an impressive                     structure in the data.</li> 
          <li>The goal is to decipher the underlying distribution in the data to gain more knowledge about the data. </li>
          <li>Some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms are:</li></ul>
          <ol><li> Clustering </li>
                    K-means
                    Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
           <li>Dimensionality Reduction</li>
                    Principal Component Analysis
          <li>Association Rule Learning</li>
                    Aprior
          </ol>
    <li> Semi - Supervised Learning </li>
       <ul><li>Semi-supervised machine learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods.</li>
           <li>Semi-supervised learning is a class of machine learning tasks and techniques that also make use of unlabeled data for training – typically a small amount of                      labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.</li>
         <li>Many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce considerable improvement              in learning accuracy</li></ul>
    <li>Reinforcement Machine Learning</li>
       <ul><li>It is the ability of an agent to interact with the environment and find out what is the best outcome.</li>
           <li>It follows the concept of hit and trial method. The agent is rewarded or penalized with a point for a correct or a wrong answer, and on the basis of the positive                reward points gained the model trains itself.</li>
         <li>And again once trained it gets ready to predict the new data presented to it.</li></ul>
