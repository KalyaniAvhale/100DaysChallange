<h1>Probability</h1>

Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event.
Probability is given by : 
P = # of ways an event can occur / # of possible outcomes

For example , 
> 1. we consider a experiment of Tossing a coin<br>
> S = {H , T} is the sample space<br>
> Therefore, Probability of getting head will be <br>
> P(H) = 1 / 2 <br>

> 2. Rolling a dice <br>
So, Sample space S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}<br>
Find probability of getting 1 ?<br>
P(1) = 1/6<br>
P(2) = 1/6 , probability of getting 2<br>

1. **Mutual Exclusive Event**<br>
A mutually exclusive event can simply be defined as a situation when two events cannot occur at same time.
Examples include: right and left hand turns, even and odd numbers on a die, winning and losing a game, or running and walking.  

2. **Non-Mutual Exclusive Event**<br>
Non-mutually exclusive events are events that can happen at the same time. 
Examples include: driving and listening to the radio, even numbers and prime numbers on a die, losing a game and scoring, or running and sweating.

3. **Dependent Event**<br>
When two events are dependent events, one event influences the probability of another event. A dependent event is an event that relies on another event to happen first. Dependent events in probability are no different from dependent events in real life: If you want to attend a concert, it might depend on whether you get overtime at work; if you want to visit family out of the country next month, it depends on whether or not you can get a passport in time. More formally, we say that when two events are dependent, the occurrence of one event influences the probability of another event.

Simple examples of dependent events:

- Robbing a bank and going to jail.
- Not paying your power bill on time and having your power cut off.
- Boarding a plane first and finding a good seat.

4. **Independent Event**<br>
An independent event is an event that has no connection to another eventâ€™s chances of happening (or not happening). In other words, the event has no effect on the probability of another event occurring. Independent events in probability are no different from independent events in real life. Where you work has no effect on what color car you drive. Buying a lottery ticket has no effect on having a child with blue eyes.

When two events are independent, one event does not influence the probability of another event.

Simple examples of independent events:

- Owning a dog and growing your own herb garden.
- Paying off your mortgage early and owning a Chevy Cavalier.
- Winning the lottery and running out of milk.
