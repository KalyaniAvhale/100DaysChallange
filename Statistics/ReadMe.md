<h1>Statistics</h1>
Statistical analysis is the main method for analyzing quantitative research data. It uses probabilities and models to test predictions about a population from sample data.

1. **Descriptive statistics :** 
<br>Descriptive statistics summarize and organize characteristics of a data set. A data set is a collection of responses or observations from a sample or entire population.
In quantitative research, after collecting data, the first step of statistical analysis is to describe characteristics of the responses, such as the average of one variable (e.g., age), or the relation between two variables (e.g., age and creativity).

- Types of descriptive statistics
There are 3 main types of descriptive statistics:

  - The distribution concerns the frequency of each value.
  - The central tendency concerns the averages of the values.
  - The variability or dispersion concerns how spread out the values are.
You can apply these to assess only one variable at a time, in univariate analysis, or to compare two or more, in bivariate and multivariate analysis.

2. **Inferential statistics :** <br>
Inferential statistics help you decide whether your data confirms or refutes your hypothesis and whether it is generalizable to a larger population.
inferential statistics help you come to conclusions and make predictions based on your data.When you have collected data from a sample, you can use inferential statistics to understand the larger population from which the sample is taken.

- Inferential statistics have two main uses:

  - making estimates about populations (for example, the mean SAT score of all 11th graders in the US).
  - testing hypotheses to draw conclusions about populations (for example, the relationship between SAT scores and family income).


> **Whatâ€™s the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?**
<br> Descriptive statistics summarize the characteristics of a data set. Inferential statistics allow you to test a hypothesis or assess whether your data is generalizable to the broader population.
