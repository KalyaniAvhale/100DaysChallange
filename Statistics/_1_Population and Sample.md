<h1> Population and Sample </h1>

<h3> Population</h3>
<p>Population is a whole ,its every member of the group.Population data set consists of all the members of the group / things that has some similarites in between
  Examples :<ol><li> Height of <b>all</b> the women in India ages 18-35</li>
            <li> Weekly time spent online in hours on social media by <b>all</b> children ages 10-15</li>
            <li> The longevity in hours for <b>all</b> 20watt CFL bulbs</li>
   As you we can see Population can be quite large.When we collect data from every member of Population we call it as census e.g India Population census
</p>
<h3> Sample </h3>
<p>Sample : Sample is subset of Population.Its the approximation of Population. Sample from population is selected at random(aka Random Sampling).<br>
  When we need to make conclusions or estimates about entire population we almost always use sample(s) from our population of intrest.<br>
  Few things to consider are:<br>
<ul><li>All elements of sample must also by definition be part of population as defined.</li>
  <li>In almost all cases(if not all ) samples from same population must be independent of each other</li>
</p>
