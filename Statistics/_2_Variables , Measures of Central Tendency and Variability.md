<h1>Variables , Measures of Central Tendency and Variability</h1>

1. <h3>Variables<br></h3>
            - Quantitative variables : Are those variables that measure in terms of numbers (Numerical variables) eg. height, weight<br><br>
	    - Qualitative varibales : Are those that expresses Qualitative attribute(categorical variables) eg. Gender , marital status<br><br>
	    - Discrete variables : Numerical data that can only take certain values.Discrete data contains distinct or separate values. eg. the number of children in a classroom or a shoe size.<br><br>
	    - Continuous variables : Numerical data that can take any value within a given range.Contains data that can be measured and is represented by Histograms. eg. the masses of 10 babies or the heights of some adults<br><br>
	    - Nominal data : Nominal Data simply names something without assigning it to an order in relation to other numbered objects or pieces of data. An example of nominal data might be a "pass" or "fail" classification for each student's test result.<br><br>
             - Ordinal Data : Ordinal data, unlike nominal data, involves some order.Ordinal numbers stand in relation to each other in a ranked fashion. 
              <br>For example, suppose you receive a survey from your favorite restaurant that asks you to provide feedback on the service you received. You can rank the quality   of service as "1" for poor, "2" for below average, "3" for average, "4" for very good and "5" for excellent.<br><br>
       
       
2. <h3>Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
       Numbers that describe what is average or typical of the distribution. You can think of this value as where the middle of a distribution lies.<br>
       <ul>
          <li><h3>Mean , Median & Mode</h3></li></ul>
  <b>Mean : </b>The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set<br>Descriptive Statistics sample mean is represented by x ¯( x bar) and μ	represents population mean<br>
  <b>Mean = {Sum of Observations} ÷ {Total number of Observations}</b><br> <br>
  <b>Median : </b>The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest.The median is found by ordering the set from lowest to highest and finding the exact middle.<br><b><br>
  if n is odd, median(x)=x<sub>(n+1)/2</sub> <br>
  if n is even, median(x)= [ x<sub>(n/2)</sub> + x<sub>(n/2)+1</sub> ] / 2 <br></b> <br>
  <b>Mode : </b>The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set.<br><br>
  
3. <h3> Measures of Variability </h3>
  	<ul><li><h3>Variance</h3></li></ul>
	The term variance refers to a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. More specifically, variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus from every other number in the set. Variance is often depicted by this symbol: σ2.<br><br>
	<b>variance σ<sup>2</sup> = [ ∑<sub>i=1</sub>(x<sub>i</sub>-x<sup>-</sup>) ]/n-1 </b><br>
where:<br>
	x<sub>i</sub> = i<sup>th</sup> data point<br>
	x<sup>-</sup> = Mean of all data points<br>
	n = Number of data points <br><br>
	A large variance indicates that numbers in the set are far from the mean and far from each other. A small variance, on the other hand, indicates the opposite. A variance value of zero, though, indicates that all values within a set of numbers are identical. Every variance that isn’t zero is a positive number. A variance cannot be negative. That’s because it’s mathematically impossible since you can’t have a negative value resulting from a square.<br><br>
	 <ul><li><h3>Standard Deviation</h3></li></ul>
	The standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance by determining each data point's deviation relative to the mean.
	If the data points are further from the mean, there is a higher deviation within the data set; thus, the more spread out the data, the higher the standard deviation.<br>

  	 <ul><li><h3>Covariance</h3></li></ul>
	In mathematics and statistics, covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. The metric evaluates how much – to what extent – the variables change together. In other words, it is essentially a measure of the variance between two variables. However, the metric does not assess the dependency between variables.<br>
	Unlike the correlation coefficient, covariance is measured in units. The units are computed by multiplying the units of the two variables. The variance can take any positive or negative values. The values are interpreted as follows:

- Positive covariance: Indicates that two variables tend to move in the same direction.<br>
- Negative covariance: Reveals that two variables tend to move in inverse directions.<br>

<ul><li><h3>Correlation Coefficient</h3></li></ul>
The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A calculated number greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0 means that there was an error in the correlation measurement. A correlation of -1.0 shows a perfect negative correlation, while a correlation of 1.0 shows a perfect positive correlation. A correlation of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two variables.

<ul><li><h3>Correlation vs. Covariance</h3></li></ul>
Covariance and correlation are related to each other, in the sense that covariance determines the type of interaction between two variables, while correlation determines the direction as well as the strength of the relationship between two variables.
