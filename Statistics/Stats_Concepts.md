      <li><h2>Variables</h2></li>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Quantitative variables</h3></li>
              Are those variables that measure in terms of numbers (Numerical variables) 
            <br>eg. height, weight</br>
            <li><h3> Qualitative varibales</h3></li>
               Are those that expresses Qualitative attribute(categorical variables)
            <br> eg. Gender , marital status</br>
            <li><h3>Discrete variables</h3></li>
	             Numerical data that can only take certain values.Discrete data contains distinct or separate values
                <br>eg. the number of children in a classroom or a shoe size.</br>
            <li><h3>Continuous variables</h3></li>
	            Numerical data that can take any value within a given range.Contains data that can be measured and is represented by Histograms
              <br>eg. the masses of 10 babies or the heights of some adults</br>
              <li><h3>Nominal data </h3></li>
              Nominal Data simply names something without assigning it to an order in relation to other numbered objects or pieces of data. 
              <br>An example of nominal data might be a "pass" or "fail" classification for each student's test result.</br>
              <li><h3>Ordinal Data</h3></li>
              Ordinal data, unlike nominal data, involves some order.Ordinal numbers stand in relation to each other in a ranked fashion. 
              <br>For example, suppose you receive a survey from your favorite restaurant that asks you to provide feedback on the service you received. You can rank the quality   of service as "1" for poor, "2" for below average, "3" for average, "4" for very good and "5" for excellent.</br>
       </ul>
       <li><h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2></li>
       Numbers that describe what is average or typical of the distribution. You can think of this value as where the middle of a distribution lies.<br>
       <ul>
          <li><h3>Mean , Median & Mode</h3></li>
  <b>Mean : </b>The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the number of values in the set<br>Descriptive Statistics sample mean is represented by x ¯( x bar) and μ	represents population mean<br>
  <b>Mean = {Sum of Observations} ÷ {Total number of Observations}</b><br> <br>
  <b>Median : </b>The median is the middle value when a data set is ordered from least to greatest.The median is found by ordering the set from lowest to highest and finding the exact middle.<br><b>
  if n is odd, median(x)=x<sub>(n+1)/2</sub> <br>
  if n is even, median(x)= [ x<sub>(n/2)</sub> + x<sub>(n/2)+1</sub> ] / 2 <br></b> <br>
  <b>Mode : </b>The mode is the number that occurs most often in a data set.<br>
  <li><h3>Variance</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Standard Deviation</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Covariance</h3></li>
       </ul>
